<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a professional and a passionate web developer where I specialize in Full Stack Web Development and I want to be the ideal web developer</p>

<p>I love to play chess most of the time, badminton occasionally. I also love reading books and encyclopaedias, not much of a bookworm but you get the note hahaha. </p>

<p>Here is a serious thing about me I am disabled as I am hard of hearing with 70% hearing loss, so I have difficulty communicating and socializing with people. Communication is better when I use google transcribe to listen and understand what everyone is saying.</p>
