<h1>The best movie according to Ankit Rastogi</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>

<p>
  Everything in this movie is perfect, the screenplay, character building and
  beautiful scene and goosebumps this movie gives me.Ending made me emotional.as
  Andy said "Hope is a good thing maybe the best of all things and no good thing
  ever dies."
</p>

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>

<p>
  A life of happniness, told by the story of a boy who belonged to the humblest
  of the origin. A man with low IQ who loved his childhood friend but there is
  always a hope which became true in the end.
</p>

<h3>Rocky</h3>

<p>
  A humble boxer who became a boxing rockstar and the rest is history. As this
  is one of the timeless classics.I have massive respect for the inspirational
  lines its says "Let me tell you something you already know, the world ain't
  sunshine and rainbows, its a very mean and nasty place i don't care how tough
  you are it will beat you to your knees permanently if you let it. You, me or
  nobody is gonna hit as hard as life, It ain't how hard you hit, its about how
  hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much you can take and keep
  moving forward , thats how winning is done."
